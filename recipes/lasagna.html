    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg" alt="Lasagna"/>
    <p>Filling and easy to make, lasagnas are great one-dish meals that check all the boxes, as they can be filled with all sorts of veggies, sauces, and proteins, and can be adjusted to many special dietary needs. Our red and white sauce lasagna is a flavorful combination of a basic white sauce, rather than ricotta cheese, and a tomato-based sauce with beef and pork that's flavored with spices and mushrooms. Covered in cheese and baked until golden, this is a great weeknight meal served with a simple salad and crusty bread.</p>
